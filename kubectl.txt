Kubernetes:
=========

kubectl:
--------

# kubectl run hello-minikube

# kubectl cluster-info

# kubectl get nodes

What is the flavour and version of Operating System on which the Kubernetes nodes are running?

Run the 
# kubectl get nodes -o wide 
command and view the OS-IMAGE column.

Once a pod network has been installed, you can confirm that it is working by checking that the CoreDNS pod is running by typing:

# sudo kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
